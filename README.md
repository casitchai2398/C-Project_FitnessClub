# C-Project_FitnessClub
This is project was accomplished as the final project of the business application course in Kelley School of Business. 
It incorporated front-end and back-end interfaces which are connected to a local text file as database.
The front-end interface helps customer service assistants provide accurate and up-to-date information concerning to price and availability to customers.
The back-end interface helps the administration to edit prices of plans, discounts, and additional features that can be provided at a certain moment.
The database can be read when information is needed to be presented and can be rewriten everytime when a customer makes an order. 
Although the firness club is fictional, developers' effort was recognized by the Information Systems Department at Kelley and ranked as the first place of the class.
